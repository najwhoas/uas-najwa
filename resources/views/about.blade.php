        <p class="card-text">Hello, let me introduce you, my name is Najwa Salsabila. I am 19 years old and will be 20 years old in September. Currently, I am in my 4th semester at Sriwijaya University, majoring in Information Systems. I have a strong interest in data and UI/UX design, and am always eager to develop my skills and knowledge in this field. During my university days, I was not very actively involved in student organizations and community projects that explore the potential of technology in improving people's quality of life. However, I believe that everyone has great potential to develop and contribute to the world, and I hope to be one of them. Thank you for visiting my profile!</p>

        <h5 class="card-title neon">HOBBIES</h5>
        <p class="card-text">I really like watching dramas and movies in the thriller, investigation, action, and fantasy genres. I think the experiences of watching such movies and dramas provides tension and excitement that cannot be found in other genres. In addition, I also like listening to jazz, lofi and chill-out music. Such musics help me to relax and calm my mind after a long day of activities. For me, these hobbies are the great way to relieve stress and enjoy my free time. Although sometimes my hectic college schedule limits my free time, I always find time to watch movies or listen to my favo musics.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title neon">INTERESTS</h5>
        <p class="card-text">I am very interested in the world of information technology, especially in the fields of data and UI/UX design. In addition, I am also interested in topics such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data analytics. During my college years, I took various courses related to these fields and was always eager to learn more about the latest developments in information technology.
In addition to my interests in information technology, I am also interested in literature and art. I love reading fiction books, especially works that have a deep moral message. In addition, I also love drawing and design, and often spend my free time developing my creativity in these areas.
With such diverse interests and activities, I always try to keep a balance in my life and maximize every opportunity to learn, develop, and explore my interests.</p>
